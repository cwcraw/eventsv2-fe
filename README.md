## Event Tracker Web App Front End

This web app allows the user to create, edit and Delete events using a simple GUI. This front end is made with react and designed to be hosted on heroku. The backend I used can be found [here](https://github.com/cwcraw/firebase-eventsV2) and is hosted on firebase.
